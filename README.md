# Welcome to the Robotics_2020 repository
##  Here you will find all the code pertaining to team 834B "the good team"

# The breakdown:
Inside of src you can find the 3 main files:
* opcontrol.cpp
* autonomous.cpp
* initialize.cpp

Inside of include you can find the 2 API files:
* main.h
* api.h

Inside of src and include you will find:
* a .h file for declarations and definitions
* a cpp file for functions and algorithms that were made to be implemented across the entire project.

Those files are custom made algorithms and methods intended to facilitate programming, driving utility, and increase the ability of the robot to complete tasks quickly, accurately, and correctly.
